# Horiseon Module 1 Challenge

- The Module Challenge for week 1 of the SMU Bootcamp
- I added an id to the search engine optimization button because it would not go to the correct part of the website once clicked. 
- I changed the website title to Horiseon
- Switched most div tags to semantic elements, and aligned css to match it.
- Added alt atributes ot the images
